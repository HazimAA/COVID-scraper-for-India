Simple code for scraping daily covid data, as well as totals from March onwards. 
I wrote this script since there were more than a few folks trying to figure out how to do so on Stack Overflow. Cheers!

Use scraper.py for daily scrapes
Use COVID_data.py for overall data on confirmed cases, active cases, testing etc

I have also included a dash script (dash_main.py) that reads the JSON file and processes it. A dash plot is created using this data.
